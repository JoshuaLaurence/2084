- Move around with WASD or the arrow keys
- Shoot with SPACE
- Avoid and destroy the ROBOTS & collect all the INFORMATION CAPSULES
- The difficulty, robot quantity & speed, enemy type, and death block amount are calculated using the wave number, so you can play endlessly
- Uses localStorage to store a HIGH SCORE in your browser, so you can keep coming back and trying to one up yourself

#### Good Luck & Enjoy
